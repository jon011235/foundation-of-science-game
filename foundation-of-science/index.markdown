This is a game about different scenarios that might be encountered when trying to build a model of the world around us

# Prerequesites
We try to keep this game as accessible as possible but you should be familiar with
- basic python
- numpy (how to perform linear arithmetic on them and function like np.isclose)

## Understanding Levels

<!-- TODO: make a nice button here and color it based on cookies set on a solve. Also only enable the next level when the previousl level was solved. Maybe generate all this structure from a external file, so it can also be used in the interface? -->

[Euclidean](marimo/game_interface.html?level=Euclidean)

[Elevator](marimo/game_interface.html?level=Elevator)

## Puzzle Level

## Geometry Levels
These definitely require more preknowledge for instance about function exponentials, cos, sin etc.
