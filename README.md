# foundation-of-science-game
A little programming game that helps to familiarize with the scientific method and its boundarys


# Level ideas:
- funky geometrys
    [x] Sphere
    [ ] hyperbolic
    [ ] 4d stuff
- simple model for complex world (ockham)
    [x] more dimensions
[x] random numbers appear to build coherrent picture
- obsever dependence (needs things that can be observed)
[ ] inter universe independence


not clear how to implement yet:
- measurement errors?

# How to get started
Right now there is not yet a whole game just single levels.
Either run `terminal_interface.py` to have a nice interface surrounding the level or create an instance of `Euclidean` in a shell and explore it directly (of course without peeking at the definition or guessing something from the name)


# How to help
If you have cool level ideas, we would love a pull request!

But more importantly we would be really interested in improving the explanation and theoretical footings. If you are knowledgeable in didactics and/or epistemology, we would love to hear your suggestions for improvement.
